# useful_swing_components
A collection of components.

BrowseTextField is basically and javax.swing.JTextField and a javax.swing.JButton situated next to each other.  I found it handy to use this component instead of repeatedly trying to align a text box and a button together.  The BrowseComponentLayout manager makes it easy.
