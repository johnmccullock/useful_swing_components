# useful_swing_components
A collection of components.

BrowseTextField is basically and javax.swing.JTextField and a javax.swing.JButton situated next to each other.  I found it handy to use this component instead of repeatedly trying to align a text box and a button together.  The BrowseComponentLayout manager makes it easy.

The BackgroundAugmentedTextArea class is basically a fix for a silly problem.  The javax.swing.JTextArea class doesn't normally allow the user to change the background color, but this inter-office messaging app I once made required different backround colors.  It's a simple work-around, and easy to use.

The DateChooser is actually a dialog that presents the user with a calendar-shaped user interface for choosing dates.
